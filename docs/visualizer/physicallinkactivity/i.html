	<h1>Visualizing Physical Link Activity</h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
    <p>
        In INET simulations, it is often advantageous to be able to show traffic between network nodes.
        For this task, there are several visualizers in INET, operating at various levels of the network stack.
        In this showcase, we demonstrate working of <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var> that can provide graphical feedback about physical layer level traffic.
    </p>
    <p>   
        The showcase consists of three simulation models each demonstrating different features of physical link visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        INET version: <var>3.6</var><br>
        Source files location: <var>inet/showcases/visualization/physicallinkactivity</var>
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the Visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        In INET, physical link activity can be visualized by including a <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var> module in the simulation.
        Adding an <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var> module is also an option, because it also contains a <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var> module.
        Physical link activity visualization is disabled by default, it can be enabled by setting the visualizer's <var>displayLinks</var> parameter to true.
    </p>
    <p>
        <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var> observes frames that pass through the physical layer, i.e. are received correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        The activity between two nodes is represented visually by a dotted arrow which points from the sender node to the receiver node.
        The arrow appears after the first frame has been received, then gradually fades out unless it is refreshed by further frames.
        Color, fading time and other graphical properties can be changed with parameters of the visualizer.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, all packets, interfaces and nodes are considered for the visualization.
        This selection can be narrowed with the visualizer's <var>packetFilter</var>, <var>interfaceFilter</var>, and <var>nodeFilter</var> parameters.
    </p>


	<p><h2>Enabling Visualization of Physical Link Activity</h2></p>
    <p>
        The following example shows how to enable the visualization of physical link activity with its default settings.
        In this example, we configure a simulation for an ad-hoc wireless network.
        The simulation can be run by choosing the <var>EnablingVisualization</var> configuration from the ini file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The network contains two <var>AdhocHosts</var>, <var>source</var> and <var>destination</var>.
        The <var>linkVisualizer's</var> type is <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>.
        In this simulation, <var>source</var> will be pinging <var>destination</var>.
    </p>
    <img class="screen" src="PhysicalLinkVisualizerSimple.png">
    <p>
        Physical link activity visualization is enabled by setting the <var>displayLinks</var> parameter to true.
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
        *.linkVisualizer.*.displayLinks = true
    </div>
    <p>
        The following animation shows what happens when we start the simulation.
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=622 height=407 src="EnablingVisualization_v0614.m4v">
    </p>
    <p>
        At the beginning of the animation, a red strip appears and moves from <var>source</var> to <var>destination</var>. 
        This strip is the standard OMNeT++ animation for packet transmissions, and has nothing to do with <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>.
        A blue dotted line also appears at the same time. It can be ignored, as it is also part of the standard OMNeT++ animation for packet transmission.
        When the frame is received in whole by <var>destination</var> (the red strip disappears), a dotted arrow is added by <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var> between the two hosts, indicating physical link activity.
        The frame's name is also displayed on the arrow.
        In this simulation, the arrow fades out quickly, because the <var>fadeOutTime</var> parameter of the visualizer is set to a small value.
    </p>


    <p><h2>Filtering Physical Link Activity</h2></p>
    <p>
        In complex networks with many nodes and several protocols in use, it is often useful to be able to filter network traffic, and visualize only the part of the traffic we are interested in. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The following example shows how to set packet filtering.
        A simulation is created for this example.
        It can be run by choosing the <var>Filtering</var> configuration from the ini file.
    </p>
    <p>
        We configure a wifi infrastructure mode network for this showcase.
        The network consists of one <var>accessPoint</var> and three <var>wirelessHosts</var> (<var>source</var>, <var>destination</var> and <var>host1</var>).
        In this configuration, the <var>source</var> host will be pinging the <var>destination</var> host.
        The <var>host1</var> node does not generate any traffic except for connect to <var>accessPoint</var>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The communication ranges of the nodes (blue circles in the picture) are reduced so that <var>source</var> and <var>destination</var> can not receive frames faultlessly from each other.<br>
    </p>
    <img width="900" class="screen" src="Filtering_sh_all_comm_ranges.png">
    <p>
        For this network, the type of <var>visualizer</var> module is <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var>.
        Physical link activity visualization is filtered to display only ping traffic.
        Other frames, e.g. Beacon frames and ACK frames, are not displayed by <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We use the following configuration for the visualization.
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.displayLinks = true<br>
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.packetFilter = "ping*"<br>
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.fadeOutTime = 5s
    </div>
    <p>
        The following video shows what happens when the simulation is run.
        The video is captured from the simulation after endpoints have associated with <var>accessPoint</var>.
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=802 height=437 src="Filtering_v0614.m4v">
    </p>
    <p>
        You can see that although there are also ACK frames, Beacon frames and ping traffic in the network, <var>PhysicalLinkVisualizer</var> displays only the latter, due to the presence of <var>packetFilter</var>.
        The ping frames travel between <var>source</var> and <var>destination</var> through <var>accessPoint</var>, but <var>host1</var> also receives ping frames from <var>accessPoint</var> and <var>source</var>.
        This is, because <var>host1</var> is within the communication range of <var>source</var> and <var>accessPoint</var>.
    </p>


	<p><h2>Physical Link Activity in a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network</h2></p>
    <p>
        The goal of this simulation is visualizing dynamically changing physical link activity in a mobile wireless environment.
        This simulation can be run by choosing the <var>Mobile</var> configuration from the ini file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The network consists of seven nodes (<var>host1..host7</var>) are type of <var>AdhocHost</var>.
        The nodes are placed randomly on the playground and will also randomly roam within predefined borders.
        The communication range of nodes is reduced so that nodes can typically communicate only with some closer nodes.
    </p>
    <img class="screen" src="PhysicalLinkVisualizerDynamic.png">
    <p>
        The nodes send UDP packets in every second by an <var>UDPBasicApp</var> application.
        The packets' name are set to <var>Broadcast</var>.
        The nodes manage the received <var>Broadcast</var> packets by an <var>UDPSink</var> application.
    </p>
    <p>        
        The visualizer's <var>packetFilter</var> parameter is set to display only <var>Broadcast</var> traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is the configuration of the visualization.
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.displayLinks = true<br>
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.packetFilter = "*Broadcast*"<br>
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.fadeOutMode = "simulationTime"<br>
        *.visualizer.*.physicalLinkVisualizer.fadeOutTime = 5s<br>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here is what happens, when we run the simulation.
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=682 height=735 src="Mobile_v0614.m4v">
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, physical link activity looks like connection graphs in which the vertices are hosts, and each edge is physical link activity between two hosts. 
        It is changing between which nodes there is physical link activity, as a result of the nodes' movement.
        When two nodes drifting away (out of the communication range of each other), the physical link is broken between them.
        If two nodes go within each other's communication range, there will be physical link activity between them.
    </p>
