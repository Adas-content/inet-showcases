    <h1>Visualizing Network Nodes</h1>

    <p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
    <p>
        In network simulations, visualizing the participants of communication is indispensable.
        Customizing nodes' appearance may also be important, for example to highlight nodes or to distinguish nodes based on location or function.
        In complex networks with many nodes, it also can be useful to visualize only the nodes we are interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
        This showcase demonstrates how network nodes are visualized in INET simulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        INET version: <var>3.6</var><br>
        Source files location: <var>inet/showcases/visualization/networknode</var>
    </p>


    <p><h2>About the Visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        In INET simulations, <var>NetworkNodeVisualizer</var> module (included in the network as part of <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var>) is responsible for visualizing network nodes.
        By default, all nodes are visualized on a 2D canvas and on a 3D osg scene.
        We can narrow the list of nodes to be displayed by setting the <var>nodeFilter</var> parameter.
        By using <var>NetworkNodeVisualizer</var> module, we also are able to customize the look of nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 2D canvas, all nodes are displayed as a 2D icon.
        Icon can be customized by setting the display string of the node.
        The icon's path, color and the colorization can be set by the "i" tag, inside the display string.
        These attributes can also be set in the node's properties.
    </p>
    <p>
        On 3D osg scene, all nodes are displayed as a 2D icon by default.
        2D icons can be replaced with 3D external models.
        It can make the simulation more understandable, however it does not have any effect on the simulation.
        The external 3D osg model is specified by the node's <var>osgModel</var> parameter.
        Color, size and other appearance settings can be changed with <var>osgModel</var> and <var>osgModelColor</var> parameters of the node.
        <br>Here are some examples:
        <ul>
        <li><var>*.example.osgModel = "example.osg.10,10,10.trans"</var><br>
            This line of code translates the example.osg by some XYZ offset.</li>
        <li><var>*.example.osgModel = "example.osg.90,10,30.rot"</var><br>
            This line of code rotates the example.osg about the XYZ axes.</li>
        <li><var>*.example.osgModel = "example.osg.5.scale"</var><br>
            This line of code scales the example.osg.</li>
        </ul>
        These parameters can be combined by writing them after each other.
        Consider the following example:<br>
        <var>*.example.osgModel = "example.osg.10,10,10.trans.90,10,30.rot"</var>.<br>
        The above code combines translation and rotation.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, the module's name is displayed, but it can be hide by setting the <var>displayModuleName</var> parameter to <var>false</var>. 
    </p>

    <p><h2>Customize Network Node Visualization</h2></p>
    <p>
        This example shows how the nodes' look can be customized.
        For this example, a simulation is created.
        It can be run by selecting the <var>VisualizingNodes</var> configuration from the ini file.
    </p>
    <p>
        The network consists of two <var>AdhocHosts</var>, <var>pedestrian</var> and <var>car</var>.
        We change the default icon of <var>pedestrian</var> by modifying its display string in the <var>NetworkNodeVisualizerShowcase.ned</var> file.
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
        pedestrian: AdhocHost {<br>
        &nbsp    @display("p=113,156;<strong>i=device/cellphone2</strong>");<br>
        }
    </div>
    <p>
        On the 2D canvas, two cellphone icons can be seen, representing <var>car</var> and <var>pedestrian</var>.
    </p>
    <img class="screen" src="VisualizingNodes_v0628.png">
    <p>
        On the 3D osg scene, you can see the same cellphone icons as on the 2D canvas.
        The cellphone icons are automatically rotating towards the camera.
    </p>
    <img width=900 class="screen" src="WithoutCustomize3D.png">
    <p>
        In our next experiment, we replace the nodes' icon with external 3D models by using the following configuration.
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
        *.pedestrian.osgModel = "boxman.osgb.(0.3).scale.0,0,45.rot"<br>
        <br>
        *.car.osgModel = "car.osgb.200.scale.0,0,45.rot"<br>
        *.car.osgModelColor = "red"<br>
    </div>
    <p>
        This configuration affects only 3D visualization.
        The following animation shows how the nodes look like after we have replaced their icon.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=700 height=400 src="CustomizedRotateCam_v2.mp4">
    </p>
    <p>
        The <var>pedestrian</var> node is represented by an animated walking boxman and the <var>car</var> is represented by a car model instead of 2D cellphone icons.
        The 3D models make the nodes recognizable even without displaying the module's name.
    </p>
