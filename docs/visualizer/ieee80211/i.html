<h1><center>Visualizing IEEE 802.11 Network Membership</center></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
When simulating wifi networks that overlap in space, it is difficult to see which node is a member of which network.
The membership may even change over time. It would be useful to be able to display e.g. the SSID above node icons.
INET provides such a visualizer that we demonstrate in this showcase.
</p>

<p>
INET version: <var>3.6</var><br>
Source files location: <var>inet/showcases/visualization/ieee80211visualizer</var>
</p>

<h2>About the visualizer</h2>

<p>
In INET, IEEE 802.11 network membership can be visualized by including a <var>Ieee80211Visualizer</var> module in the simulation. Adding an <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var> is also an option, because it also contains a <var>Ieee80211Visualizer</var>. Displaying network membership is disabled by default, it can be enabled by setting the visualizer's <var>displayAssociations</var> parameter to <code>true</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <var>Ieee80211Visualizer</var> displays an icon and the SSID above network nodes which are part of a wifi network.
The icons are color-coded according to the SSID. The icon, colors, and other visual properties can be configured
via parameters of the visualizer.
<!--The icon is also displayed above nodes that create the networks, e.g. access points.--> <!--Additionally, the icon indicates the signal strength present at the
location of a given node. TODO: how is it indicated? and how does it work?-->
</p>

<p>
The visualizer's <var>nodeFilter</var> parameter selects which nodes' memberships are visualized. The <var>interfaceFilter</var> parameter
selects which interfaces are considered in the visualization. By default, all interfaces of all nodes are considered.
</p>

<h2>Basic use</h2>

<p>
The first example simulation demonstrates the visualization with the default visualizer settings. It can be run by
choosing the <var>OneNetwork</var> configuration from the ini file. The simulation uses the following network:
</p>

<img class="screen" src="simplenetwork.png">

<p>
The network contains a <var>WirelessHost</var> and an <var>AccessPoint</var>. The access point SSID is left
at the default setting, <var>"SSID"</var>. At the beginning of the simulation,
the host will initate association with the access point. When the association process goes through,
the node becomes part of the wireless network, and this should be indicated by the icon. 
</p>

<p>
The visualization is activated with the visualizer's <var>displayAssociations</var> parameter:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
*.visualizer.*.ieee80211Visualizer.displayAssociations = true
</div>

<p>
When the simulation is run for a while, the network will look like the following. Note the icons above the host and the access point.
</p>

<h2>Multiple networks</h2>

<p>
The following example simulation demonstrates the visualization when multiple networks are present. The simulation can be run by choosing the <var>MultipleNetworks</var> configuration from the ini file. 
</p>

<p>
The network contains two <var>AccessPoints</var> with different SSIDs, and three <var>WirelessHosts</var>
configured to associate with each. We will see the icons being color-coded.
When the association processes take place, the network will look like the following. Note the different
SSIDs (<code>alpha</code>, <code>bravo</code>) and the colors.
</p>

<img class="screen" src="advanced.png">

<!--
TODO
There are 2 wireless networks, with different colors.
The icon indicates signal strength. The node close to access point alpha has the strongest signal,
the node farther away from access point alpha has the second strongest.
The wall reduces the strength of the signal from access point bravo. It depends on distance as well.
So, A1 has 4 bars, A2 3 bars, B1 2 bars, B2 one bar. Or something like that.
-->

<h2>Visualizing handover</h2>

<p>
The following example simulation shows how visualization can help you follow handovers in the network. The simulation can be run by choosing the <var>VisualizingHandover</var> configuration from the ini file.
The network contains two <var>AccessPoints</var> with different SSIDs, <var>alpha</var> and <var>bravo</var>. There is also a <var>WirelessHost</var> which is configured to move horizontally back and forth between the two access points. Transmission powers are configured so that when a host gets near one access point, it will go out of the range of the other access point. This will trigger a handover. 
</p>

<p>
The communication ranges of the access points are visualized as blue circles. The following animation shows what happens when the simulation is run. Note how the indicator above the host changes after each handover.
