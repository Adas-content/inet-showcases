<h1>Visualizing Terrain and Urban Environment</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
It is often desirable for simulations to have a real world context. One way
to achieve this is to place network nodes on a real world map. The map doesn't
have any effect on the simulation, it only alters the visuals of the network.
However, objects can be added to represent buildings, which can affect the simulation.
</p>

<p>
This showcase is about placing a map in the simulation. It contains three
example configurations of increasing complexity, each demonstrating various features of the visualization. 
</p>

<p>
INET version: <var>3.6</var><br>
Source files location: <var>inet/showcases/visualization/earth</var>
</p>

<h2>About the Visualizer</h2>

<p>
The map can be displayed by including a <var>SceneOsgEarthVisualizer</var> module in the network. It can display the map on the 3D scene by
using osgEarth, thus any part of the world can be inserted (provided there is a source for the map data). The use of the map requires an internet connection, and it is only available in the 3D scene.
</p>

<h2>Visualization with the Default Settings</h2>

<p>
This example configuration demonstrates inserting the map of downtown Boston into the simulation. It can be run by choosing the
<var>DefaultSettings</var> configuration from the ini file. It uses the following network:
</p>

<img class="screen" src="defaultnetwork.png">

<p>
The network contains an <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var> module, and an <var>OsgGeographicCoordinateSystem</var> module.
The configuration from omnetpp.ini is the following:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
*.visualizer.osgVisualizer.sceneVisualizerType = "SceneOsgEarthVisualizer"
*.visualizer.osgVisualizer.sceneVisualizer.mapFile = "boston.earth"

*.coordinateSystem.playgroundLongitude = -71.06792deg
*.coordinateSystem.playgroundLatitude = 42.35717deg
</pre>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
By default, the type of the scene visualizer module in <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var> is <var>SceneOsgVisualizer</var>.
Inserting the map requires the <var>SceneOsgEarthVisualizer</var> module, thus the default osg scene visualizer is replaced. The <var>SceneOsgEarthVisualizer</var> provides the same functionality as <var>SceneOsgVisualizer</var>,
and adds support for the osgEarth map.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
To display the map, the visualizer requires a .earth file. This is an XML file that specifies how the source data is
turned into a map, and how to fetch the necessary data from the internet. In this configuration,
the <span stype="font-family: monospace;">boston.earth</span> file is used. There are more .earth files in the osgEarth directory, and at <a href="http://osgearth.org" target="_blank">osgearth.org</a>. There are also instructions on this site on how to create .earth files.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Locations on the map are selected with geographical coordinates, i.e. longitude and latitude. In INET, locations of nodes and objects are represented internally by cartesian coordinates. The <var>OsgGeorgraphicCoordinateSystem</var> module is responsible
for converting between geographical and cartesian coordinates.
The geographical coordinates of the cartesian coordinate system's origin must be specified, to connect the map and
the location of nodes and objects in the simulation. The origin's coordinates are specified by the visualizer's
<var>playgroundLongitude</var> and <var>playgroundLatitude</var> parameters.
 In this configuration, the origin is set to somewhere near Boston Common park. Additionally, the origin's altitude
 can be configured, However, specifying the latitude and longitude is sufficient for the map visualization to work.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The size of the playground is determined automatically, taking into account the position of objects, network nodes,
and movement contraints of network nodes. Thus everything in the simulation should happen within the boundaries of the
playground. The playground's elevation, heading, and bank can be specified in the coordinate system module. The playground is visible by default. When the simulation starts, the view will be centered on the cartesian coordinate system's origin if there are no nodes in the network. If there are nodes, the initial viewpoint will be set so that all nodes are visible.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It looks like the following when the simulation is run:
</p>

<a href="defaultmap.png" data-lightbox="defaultmap"><img class="shadow" src="defaultmap.png" width="850px"></a>

<p>
The map is displayed on the 3D scene. Since there are no nodes or objects in the network, the size of the playground
is zero (thus not visible).
</p>

<h2>Adding Physical Objects</h2>

<p>
The map doesn't affect simulations in any way, just gives a real world context to them. For network nodes to interact
with their environment, physical objects have to be added. The example configuration for this section can be run by selecting the <var>PhysicalObjects</var> configuration from the ini file. It extends the previous configuration by adding physical objects to the simulation. The objects are placed in the simulation to align with the building blocks
on the map; they are meant to represent those building blocks. The objects could affect radio transmissions if an obstacle loss model was set.
</p>

<p>
The network for this configuration extends the network from the previous section with a <var>PhysicalEnvironment</var> module:
</p>

<img class="screen" src="objectsnetwork.png">

<p>
The configuration for this example simulation extends the previous configuration with the following:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
*.physicalEnvironment.coordinateSystemModule = "coordinateSystem"
*.physicalEnvironment.config = xmldoc("obstacle.xml")
</pre>

<p>
The <var>PhysicalEnvironment</var> module is responsible for placing the physical objects on the playground.
The physical environment module doesn't use a coordinate system module by default, but it is set to use the
one present in the network. This makes it possible to define the objects using geographical coordinates.
The objects are defined in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">obstacle.xml</span> config file.
</p>

<p>
It looks like the following when the simulation is run:
</p>

<a href="objectsmap.png" data-lightbox="objectsmap"><img class="shadow" src="objectsmap.png" width="850px"></a>

<p>
The objects representing building blocks are displayed with transparent red, and there is a line of trees on the other
side of the road displayed in transparent green.
</p>

<p>TODO: the playground is also visible -> when it is fixed</p>

<h2>Placing Network Nodes on the Map</h2>

<p>
This example configuration demonstrates the placement of network nodes on the map. The simulation can be run
by choosing the <var>NetworkNodes</var> configuration from the ini file. The network for this configuration extends
the previous network with a radio medium and a network configurator module. It also adds two <var>AdhocHosts</var>:
</p>

<img class="screen" src="nodesnetwork.png">

<p>
The configuration extends the previous configuration with the following:
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
*.visualizer.osgVisualizer.sceneVisualizer.playgroundShading = false
*.visualizer.osgVisualizer.sceneVisualizer.playgroundColor = "#000000"
*.visualizer.osgVisualizer.sceneVisualizer.playgroundOpacity = 0.1

*.coordinateSystem.playgroundAltitude = 1m
*.coordinateSystem.playgroundHeading = 68.3deg

*.host*.mobilityType = "StationaryMobility"
*.host*.mobility.coordinateSystemModule = "coordinateSystem"
*.host*.mobility.initialAltitude = 1m
*.host*.mobility.initFromDisplayString = false

*.host1.mobility.initialLatitude = 42.35659deg
*.host1.mobility.initialLongitude = -71.06762deg

*.host2.mobility.initialLatitude = 42.35585deg
*.host2.mobility.initialLongitude = -71.06727deg

*.host3.mobility.initialLatitude = 42.35716deg
*.host3.mobility.initialLongitude = -71.06911deg

*.host4.mobility.initialLatitude = 42.35685deg
*.host4.mobility.initialLongitude = -71.06639deg
</pre>

<p>
The first block of keys configure the playground to be transparent black, so the underlying
map is visible. The next block sets the altitude of the playground. By default, the altitude is
zero; it is set to one meter, so the nodes are not on the level of the ground. The heading is also specified,
so that the edges of the playground roughly aligns with the streets on the map.
</p>

<p>
Network nodes are placed on the map by setting their mobility type to <var>StationaryMobility</var>.
This mobility module has parameters which can position the node with geographical coordinates.
</p>

<p>
The required coordinates can be easily obtained from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org" target="_blank">www.openstreetmap.org</a>. Choose <span style="font-family: monospace;">Share</span> from the menu at the right,
and tick <span style="font-family: monospace;">Include marker</span>. The marker can be dragged on the map, and the coordinates of the marker's
location is shown in the Share panel.
</p>

<p>
The playground is visible against the map. The nodes are placed on the playground.
