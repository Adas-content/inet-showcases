	<h1>Visualizing Mobility</h1>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>
	<p>
		In INET simulations, movements of mobile nodes are often as important as the communication between nodes.
		When mobile nodes are roaming in the network, it is difficult to follow their movement.
    </p>
    <p>
        In INET nodes' mobility is displayed by a visualizer.
        Using this visualizer, mobile nodes can be tracked easily.
    </p>
    <p>    
        This showcase consists of one simulation model, that demonstrates important features of mobility visualization.
    </p>
    <p>
        INET version: <var>3.6</var><br>
        Source files location: <var>inet/showcases/visualization/mobility</var>
    </p>

    <p><h2>About the Visualizer</h2></p>
    <p>
        In INET, mobility of nodes can be visualized by <var>MobilityVisualizer</var> module (included in the network as part of <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var>).
        By default, mobility visualization is enabled, it can be disabled by setting <var>displayMovements</var> parameter to false.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, all mobilities are considered for the visualization.
        This selection can be narrowed with the visualizer's <var>moduleFilter</var> parameter.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        The visualizer has several important features:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b>Movement Trail</b></li>
    <p>
        Movement trail displays a line along the recent path of movements.
        The trail gradually fades out as time passes.
        Color, trail length and other graphical properties can be changed with parameters of the visualizer.
    </p>
    <li><b>Velocity Vector</b></li>
    <p>
        Velocity is represented visually by an arrow.
        Its starting point is the node and its direction coincides with the movement's direction.
        The arrow's length is proportional to the node's speed, but it can be multiplied.
    </p>
    <li><b>Orientation Arc</b></li>
    <p>
        Orientation is represented by an arc whose size is specified by the <var>orientationArcSize</var> parameter.
        This value is the relative size of the arc compared to a full circle.
        The arc's default value is 0.25, i.e. a quarter or a circle.
    </p>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These features are disabled by default, they can be enabled by setting the visualizer's <var>displayMovementTrails</var>, <var>displayVelocities</var> and <var>displayOrientations</var> parameters to true.
    </p>

	<p><h2>Visualizing Mobility Features</h2></p>
    <p>
        The following example shows how to enable mobility visualization features.
        We create a simulation for this example that can be run by choosing the <var>VisualizingFeatures</var> configuration from the ini file.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three <var>AdhocHost</var> type nodes (<var>host1</var>, <var>host2</var> and <var>host3</var>) are placed in the playground.
        They are roaming within predefined borders.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following video is captured from the simulation.
        The default settings of mobility visualization are used.
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=822 height=707 src="NoFeatures_v0620.m4v">
    </p>
    <p>
        It is difficult to track the nodes, because they are moving randomly and quite fast.
        In our next experiment, we enable movement trails, velocity vectors and orientation arcs.
        We expect that nodes can be tracked easier.
    </p>
    <div class="snippet">
        # Movement trail<br>
        *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayMovementTrails = true<br>
        *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.trailLength = 300
        <br>
        # Velocity vector<br>
        *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayVelocities = true<br>
        <br>
        # Orientation arc<br>
        *.visualizer.*.mobilityVisualizer.displayOrientations = true<br>
    </div>
    <p>
        When we start the simulation, here is what happens.
    </p>
    <p align="center">        
        <video autoplay loop controls onclick="this.paused ? this.play() : this.pause();" width=822 height=707 src="VisualizingFeatures_v0627.m4v">
    </p>
    <p>
        Compare this video to the previous one!
        The first thing you can notice is that hosts' movements are the same as in the previous video.
        However, note, that <var>host3</var> is not moving randomly, but in a circular arc.
        The <var>host1</var> and <var>host2</var> nodes can also be easily tracked because of mobility visualization.
    </p>

        This example only demonstrated the key features of mobility visualization.
