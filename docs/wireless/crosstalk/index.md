title: Crosstalk between adjacent IEEE 802.11 channels

By default, 802.11 hosts and access points are configured to use the same wifi channel, (channel x).
In reality, however, it is rarely the case. There are many wifi networks, typically
on all channels (especially in the case of 2.4 GHz wifi where there are a low number of
channels compared to 5 GHz).

INET has support for simulating the different wifi channels, both in 2.4 GHz and in 5 GHz.
This showcase demonstrates using this feature. It contains three example simulations, each demonstrating
a case of frequency overlappedness of channels.
