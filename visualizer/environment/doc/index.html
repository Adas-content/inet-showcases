<h1>Visualizing Physical Environment</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
The physical environment has a profound effect on the communication of wireless devices. For example, physical objects
like walls inside buildings constraint mobility. They also obstruct radio signals often resulting in packet loss. 
It's difficult to make sense of the simulation without actually seeing where physical objects are.
</p>

<p>
The visualization of physical objects present in the physical environment is essential. This showcase contains two example simulations, which demonstrate the visualization of physical objects.
</p>

<p>
INET version: <var>3.6</var><br>
Source files location: <var>inet/showcases/visualization/environment</var>
</p>

<h2>About the visualizer</h2>

<p>
The <var>PhysicalEnvironmentVisualizer</var> (also part of <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var>) is responsible for displaying the physical objects. The objects themselves
are provided by the <var>PhysicalEnvironment</var> module; their geometry, physical and visual properties are defined in the XML configuration of the <var>PhysicalEnvironment</var> module.
</p>

<p>
The two-dimensional projection of physical objects is determined by the <var>SceneCanvasVisualizer</var> module.
(This is because the projection is also needed by other visualizers, for example <var>MobilityVisualizer</var>.)
The default view is top view (z axis), but you can also configure side view (x and y axes), or isometric or ortographic projection.
</p>

<h2>The default view</h2>

<p>
This example configuration (<var>DefaultView</var> in the ini file) demonstrates the default visualization of objects. The objects are defined in the <var>indoor.xml</var> file,
which depicts an apartment with three rooms. The network contains just two modules, a <var>PhysicalEnvironment</var> and
an <var>IntegratedVisualizer</var> module.
When the simulation is run, the network looks like this:

<h2>The isometric view</h2>

<p>
In this example configuration (<var>IsometricView</var> in the ini file), the view is set to isometric projection. This is done by setting
the <var>viewAngle</var> parameter in <var>SceneVisualizer</var>:
</p>

<div class="snippet">
*.visualizer.canvasVisualizer.sceneVisualizer.viewAngle = "isometric"
</div>

<p>
When the simulation is run, the network looks like the following.
</p>

<h2>3D visualization</h2>

<p>
The visualizer also supports OpenGL-based 3D rendering using the OpenSceneGraph (OSG) library. 
If your OMNeT++ installation has been compiled with OSG support, you can switch to 3D view
using the toolbar. The result will look like the following.
Note that the <var>SceneVisualizer</var> view settings have no effect on the 3D view, you can use the mouse to move the camera and change the view angle.
