	<center><h1>Hidden Node Example</h1></center>

	<p><h2>Goals</h2></p>

	<p>
		This showcase demonstrates the hidden node problem in 802.11 wireless networks,
		and the RTS/CTS mechanism that addresses it.
	</p>

	<p><strong>Description of the hidden node problem</strong></p>

		<p>
		For example, the hidden node problem occurs in a wireless network when two transmitting nodes are
		out of range of each other, and cannot detect when the other is transmitting. They simultaneously
		transmit to an intermediate node that is in transmission range of both. Since
		they don't know when the other is transmitting, normal collision avoidance
		is not effective, and their transmissions will often interfere at the intermediate node.
		Note that this is the simplest hidden node problem, there are more complicated ones
		(see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_node_problem" target="blank">Hidden node problem</a> on wikipedia.)
	</p>

<p>
		The solution employed in 802.11 networks is to use Request to send/Clear to send frames (RTS/CTS).
		Before transmitting a frame, hosts send an RTS frame addressed to the target node. The target node then replies
		with a CTS frame if the channel is idle. In response to the CTS frame, the transmitting node transmits
		the original frame.
</p>

<p>
		A nearby hidden node cannot receive the RTS, but it receives the CTS, which indicates
		that there is another node out of range, about to transmit. It defers from transmitting, until
		the ongoing transmission is over. It knows the exact time the transmission will take from the duration field of the CTS frame. The CTS, RTS and ACK frames each have a duration field, which indicate how much time is left until the
		entire packet exchange (RTS, CTS, payload frame, and ACK) is completed. Thus any node that receives one of the frames
		knows when the channel will become available for transmission.
</p>

<p><strong>Demonstrating the hidden node problem</strong></p>

<p>
	The showcase contains four simulation models. The first one doesn't use the RTS/CTS mechanism, so effectively the hidden node problem is
	not addressed here. The second one adds the RTS/CTS mechanism, which addresses the problem, adding some overhead to the
	transmissions in the process. The third and forth are for reference, showing what would happen if there were no hidden nodes in the first place.
</p>

<p><h2>The model</h2></p>

	<p>
		The network for all simulations contains three hosts, arranged in a triangle.
		Host A and C are separated by a wall which completely blocks transmissions, thus the nodes cannot transmit to each other, and cannot sense when the other is transmitting. The wall is enabled or disabled in the various simulations.
		They both send UDP packets to Host B, which can receive the transmissions
		of both hosts.
	</p>

		<p>The RTS/CTS mechanism can be enabled or disabled by setting the <var>rtsThresholdBytes</var> parameter in the <var>MAC</var> module of hosts. The RTS/CTS mechanism is used
			before packets whose size exceeds the size of the threshold.

		<p>In the first configuration (<var>WallOnRTSoff</var>), the RTS/CTS mechanism is disabled. Host A and C will likely transmit at the same time very often. This will result in
			collisions at Host B. In the <var>WallOnRTSoff</var> configuration, the RTS/CTS mechanism is enabled. This is expected to reduce the number of collisions, and Host B will receive
			more packets correctly than in the previous configuration. In the third model the wall is removed, and RTS/CTS is disabled. This model will highlight the effect of the RTS/CTS mechanism and the
			RTS/CTS overhead. 
			In the <var>WallOffRtsOn</var> configuration, the wall is disabled and RTS/CTS is enabled. Again, this configuration will show the effects of the RTS/CTS mechanism. This way the four models can be compared
			by the number of packets received at Host B.

		<p><h2>Results</h2></p>

		<p><strong>RTS/CTS disabled</strong></p>

		<p>
			Both Host A and C frequently transmit simultaneously, thus the number of collisions at Host B is high.
		</p>

		<p>
			The animation above depicts such a collision. Host C starts transmitting, and Host A starts transmitting as well, before Host C's transmission is over.
			As neither packet can be received correctly by Host B (and thus they are not ACKed), Hosts A and C retry transmitting the same packet multiple times after the backoff period.
			The retransmitted packets also collide, because the packets are long compared to the backoff period. Finally, Host C manages to send its packet without interference.

		<p>Here is what a collision looks like in the log:</p>

		<img class="screen" src="collision.png">

		<p>The number of packets received by Host B: <strong>849</strong></p>

		<p><strong>RTS/CTS enabled</strong></p>

		<p>
			With RTS/CTS enabled, there are no more collisions, except for between RTS frames. RTS and CTS frames are much shorter than data frames (about 50ns vs 2ms), thus the probability of RTS frames colliding is less than for data frames.
			The result is that a low number of RTS frames collide, and since they are short, the collisions don't take up much time.

			The following sequence chart illustrates that the RTS/CTS mechanism makes the communication more orderly, as the nodes know when to transmit
			in order to avoid collisions. It also illustrates that RTS and CTS frames are much shorter than data frames.

		<p>The number of received packets at Host B: <strong>1712</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Wall removed, RTS/CTS disabled</strong></p>

		<p>
			With the wall removed, hidden nodes are no longer a problem, because collision avoidance mechanisms can work.
			The number of collisions is low.
		</p>

		<p><strong>Wall removed, RTS/CTS enabled</strong></p>

		<p>
		When this simulation is compared to the previous one, one might think
		the RTS/CTS overhead can be shown. There is no hidden node problem in these
		two simulations, thus the use of the RTS/CTS mechanism might not be mandated,
		and if used, it would only decrease the number of successfully received packets
		because the RTS/CTS overhead. However, the use of RTS/CTS actually increased
		the number of successfully received packets. The use of RTS/CTS stops data frame
		collisions. Only RTS and CTS frames can collide, which are much shorter than data
		frames, thus retransmissions take up less time than with data frames. Overall,
		the communication is more orderly.
